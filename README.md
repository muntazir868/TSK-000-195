Emotion Recognition from Text 
Description	
Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text and classify the emotion expressed.
Preprocess text data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and applying other text cleaning techniques.
Build a machine learning model, such as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based models like BERT, to classify emotions from text.
Train the model using labeled emotion data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
